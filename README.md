# Deep Learning Practice: Perceptrons & Foundations

This notebook contains a set of solved practice questions covering the core concepts of Deep Learning and Perceptrons. 

### Topics Covered:
1. Perceptron Architecture & Components (Weights, Bias, Activation)
2. Geometrical Interpretation of Decision Boundaries
3. Linear Separability (AND, OR vs XOR logic gate)
4. Perceptron Learning Rule & Weight Update Mechanism
5. Limitations of Single-Layer Perceptrons and the shift to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)
