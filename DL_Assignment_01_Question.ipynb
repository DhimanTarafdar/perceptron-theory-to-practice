        "\n",
        "1. **Weights ($w$):** Weights represent the importance or \"strength\" of each input. Not all inputs are equally important. If an input has a higher weight, it has a bigger impact on the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bias ($b$):** Bias is like an extra \"adjustment\" factor. It helps the model make decisions even when all inputs are zero. It allows the activation function to shift up or down to make the model more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Activation Function:** This is the final decision-maker. It takes the total sum of (inputs × weights + bias) and decides whether the neuron should \"fire\" (output 1) or stay \"silent\" (output 0). A common example is the **Step Function**.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it works (The Role):\n",
        "The perceptron multiplies each input by its weight, adds them all together with the bias, and then passes the result through the activation function to get the final prediction.\n"
